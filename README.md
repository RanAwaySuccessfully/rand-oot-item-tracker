# OoT Randomizer Item Tracker
I wanted to make a better item tracker, so I did. Now that I think about it, I don't really know why anyone would use this one in particular, but it exists. It certainly exists.

It's not finished yet, but it's already in an usable state.

# To Do List

**v0.9:**
- Child Trading Quest Items
- Adult Trading Quest Items
- Magic Beans Counter
- Make the item tracker have a pop-out window for easier capturing

**v1.0:**
- Clicking on the bottom-right corner of a song/medallion/stone to mark that location as completed.
- Chest Locations

**v1.1:**
- Custom Icon Sets
