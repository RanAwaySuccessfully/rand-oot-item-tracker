      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>This is a web-based item tracker for a game called "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time". Except, this is not for the standard game, it's for a different version where all the item locations are shuffled!</p>
      <p>This item tracker is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/RanAwaySuccessfully/rand-oot-item-tracker">GitHub</a>. You can go there to report <a href="https://github.com/RanAwaySuccessfully/rand-oot-item-tracker/issues">any issues or suggestions</a> or make any <a href="https://github.com/RanAwaySuccessfully/rand-oot-item-tracker/pulls">pull requests</a>.</p>

      <h1>Help</h1>
      <p>The page will keep track of all your settings, items, chests via cookies, so you don't have to worry about losing any information when you close it.</p>
      
      <h2>Item Tracker</h2>
      <p>In here you can mark which items you've already collected. You can click any item on the tracker to toggle its state, and you can also right-click to toggle it backwards.</p>
      
      <p>Songs, spiritual stones and medallions will display a checkmark when clicked on its lower-right corner. This is useful for marking song locations you've visited along with the songs you have collected. You can disable this feature in the tracker's settings.</p>
      
      <p>There's also some counters for other miscellaneous items below the tracker. You can type in a custom number in these, or you can press the plus and minus buttons to increase/decrease the counter. You can type anything you want there, really, but only valid numbers are saved.</p>
      
      <h2>Dungeon Tracker</h2>
      <p>The dungeon tracker is useful for marking the location of the medallions and spiritual stones. It also tracks the amount of keys collected of all dungeons and the boss key, which is incredibly useful if you're playing on Keysanity mode.</p>
      
      <p>The boss keys, you just click to change them. For the key counter, however, you have to type in the amount of keys or click on the buttons on its side.</p>
      
      <h2>Map Tracker</h2>
      <p>The map tracker will display the location of all chests, skulltulas, songs and other items which were shuffled. It'll look at the items you have collected so far and display red or green for each chest that's either unavailable or available for you to collect. You can mark a chest as collected by clicking on it, which marks it with a gray color.</p>
      
      <p>Some are grouped by location, in which you have to click the location and then browse through a list of items available there. These will display red if you can't collect anything there yet, yellow if you can collect some of the items there, and green if you can collect every item there.</p>
      
      <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The map tracker will keep track of the items you have collected, <strong>even if these items are not visible onscreen.</strong> If the list of available chests looks weird, you may need to add a few items back to the grid to see if there are any marked incorrectly.</p>
      
      <h2>Edit Mode</h2>
      <p>Useful for making changes to the layout of the page. Just click "EDIT" on the bottom-right corner of the screen to toggle it. To edit the item grid, click on a square that has an item and then click on another square to move the previous item there. If the latter square already had an item, then both will swap places. You can also do this by dragging and dropping!</p>
      
      <p>You can change the size of the item grid as well, by pressing the plus and minus buttons on the right, you can add/remove a cell from the table, and the ones on the bottom add/remove entire rows. The minimum size is 1x1 and the maximum is as many as you browser can handle.</p>
      
      <h2>Settings</h2>
      <p>While on Edit Mode, click the "SETTINGS" button (located right below the main item tracker) to open the settings. Some settings are based on what logic you chose for the randomizer, these change what the map tracker will display. The rest are changes to the page and how it'll look or function.</p>
      
      <p>You can toggle a pop-out window with the item tracker by clicking on "Pop-Out Item Tracker". This is great if you need the page to occupy less space on-screen or if you need to record it. Clicking on "Reset Map/Items" will reset all the list of all the items you obtained and all item locations you've gotten, while "Reset All Settings" is self-explanatory.</p>
      
      <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If something is acting funky on the randomizer right after it was updated, then you may need to reset the cookies on the page to fix it. You can do so by clicking "Reset All Settings".</p>
      
      <h2>Import/Export</h2>
      <p>You can export your item tracker by clicking 'Export', so others can see what you've collected. Anyone with the file can then import it back by clicking 'Import'. Note that all your settings are exported, although someone can choose to import only the item/chests if they want to.</p>
